# Wikimate

Tell an AI agent **"organize this,"** and it takes your scattered materials (web links, PDFs, chat logs, text), **organizes them into notes in your Obsidian vault**, **links** related notes together, **classifies** them, **summarizes** them, and if you want, **indexes them in Notion** — a **Claude Code plugin**. (Codex has no "plugin install (`/plugin`)" — instead, you clone the repo and register it as an **MCP server** via `codex mcp add`.)

**[한국어 (Korean version)](./README.md)** · **View as HTML: [README.en.html](./README.en.html)**

> 📱 **Device note**: Wikimate is **Windows-PC only (desktop/laptop)**. It is **not installable on phones or tablets** (Claude Code and Codex, the AI programs you talk to, are themselves PC-only programs).

> ✅ **Current status (as of 2026-09-01, honestly)**: Current version **v0.10.0**. All **8** MCP tools are merged into `main` and pushed to GitHub. **All 223 automated tests pass** (`npm run verify`), verified via the real server protocol and via real Obsidian-vault end-to-end runs. **Every push to `main` triggers GitHub's own server to re-run the same checks plus a security scan automatically** (GitHub Actions). The session-start auto-detection (hook) and the Obsidian graph-view reflection have been **confirmed on real screens in the user's own environment** (screenshot evidence). **Notion round-trip indexing and a marketplace reinstall have also been confirmed live in the user's own environment** (2026-09-01). See [17. Current status, honestly](#17-current-status-honestly) for the item-by-item breakdown.

This document is written so that **someone who has never touched AI, a computer, a mobile device, or any electronic device before** can follow it step by step from top to bottom. Every hard term is spelled out in plain language.

## 1. What is Wikimate? (1-minute overview)

It's an **AI assistant** that organizes your scattered materials.

Think of it this way — when your desk is piled with receipts, notes, and links, saying "organize this for me" gets you an assistant that **automatically sorts everything into notes in folders**, **threads related notes together**, **groups similar topics into a table of contents**, and **writes a one-line summary of anything long**. Just like asking an assistant over chat (like a messaging app), **you simply say what you want in plain language.**

- Organized results pile up as notes in **Obsidian**, a note-taking app. (Stored only on your own computer = never sent out.)
- If you want, it also writes a list row into a **Notion** table. (Optional.)
- Related notes get **automatically threaded together** (auto-link), and similar topics get grouped into a **table-of-contents note (MOC)**.
- Notes that don't have a folder/tags yet get a proposed **folder and tags** based on AI judgment.
- Overly long notes get a **one-line summary**, or a separate **atomic note** with just the key points pulled out (the original is never touched).
- **It never deletes or changes things on its own.** It always reports "I'm about to do this" first, and only proceeds once you say yes.

> One-line summary: **Say "organize this," and it organizes your notes app into clean notes, links them together, classifies them, and even summarizes them.**

## 2. 30-second glossary (for beginners)

Don't panic if you see an unfamiliar word — the common ones are explained here in plain terms.

| Word | Plain meaning (analogy) |
|---|---|
| **AI agent** | A smart program that understands what you say and does the work for you (= an assistant) |
| **Claude Code** | A program on your computer that lets you **tell AI what to do, in words** (looks like a chat window) |
| **Codex** | **Another AI tool** similar to Claude Code (you only need one of the two) |
| **Plugin** | A **part that plugs a new feature** into a program (like installing one more app on your phone) |
| **Marketplace** | The **app store** you get plugins from |
| **MCP** | The **standard pipe (outlet)** connecting AI to tools. Wikimate does its work through this pipe. |
| **MCP tool** | A **feature button** the AI can press through that pipe (Wikimate has 8 — see [§12](#12-command-reference)) |
| **The `/wikimate` slash command** | A **direct command** to use when "organize this" sometimes doesn't fire (100% reliable) |
| **Obsidian** | The **note-taking app** on your computer where organized results are stored |
| **Vault** | The **note-storage folder** in Obsidian that holds your notes. It has a **name** you gave it. |
| **Notion** | An app for organizing tables/documents (optional — only if you want a list view) |
| **Terminal / cmd / CLI** | The **black window** where you type text commands (built into Windows) |
| **Node.js** | The **free engine (foundation)** Wikimate runs on — install it once |
| **Git** | A tool for **downloading a whole folder** from the internet (advanced/optional) |
| **dry-run** | **Showing "just the plan"** before actually doing it (= a preview) |
| **frontmatter** | The **small info table** attached to the top of a note (title, tags, date, etc.) |
| **source_hash** | A **fingerprint** used to recognize the same material (for automatic dedup) |
| **99_Archive** | A folder for **moving notes without deleting them** (easy to undo) |
| **related (related notes)** | The list of "other notes related to this one" written in a note's info table. Max 5. |
| **MOC (Map of Content)** | A table-of-contents note that gathers notes on the same topic in one place |
| **Atomic note** | A short new note with just the key points pulled from a longer note (the original is left as-is) |
| **SessionStart hook** | A notification script that **runs automatically once, when you start** Claude Code |
| **Subagent** | A helper AI that runs **separately** from the main AI to do one specific job (like review) |
| **Prompt injection** | A trap sentence hidden inside external text, like "ignore previous instructions and do X." Wikimate blocks this by treating it as data, never as a command. |

> 💡 You don't need to memorize any of this — just come back to this table whenever you hit an unfamiliar word.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

| Item | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **A computer (Windows)** | ✅ Required | This document assumes Windows 11. (Not phones/tablets.) |
| **Node.js 18 or newer** | ✅ Required | The free program Wikimate runs on. (Install in [§4](#4-how-to-download-the-required-programs).) |
| **Claude Code** or **Codex** | ✅ Required | The AI tool you'll tell "organize this" to. **You only need one of the two.** |
| **Obsidian** | 🔶 Optional | Install if you want to see your organized notes visually. Files are still created without it (filesystem fallback). |
| **Notion** | 🔶 Optional | Only if you want a table/list view. Not required. |
| **Git** | 🔶 Optional | Only needed for Codex use, or if you're pulling the repo like a developer. |

> 💡 **You only strictly need 3 things**: a Windows computer + Node.js + (Claude Code or Codex). Everything else is optional.

---

## 4. How to download the required programs

### ① Node.js (required)
1. Type **nodejs.org** into your browser's address bar → go there.
2. Click the big green button labeled **LTS** to download it. (LTS = "the long-term-stable version")
3. Double-click the downloaded file → keep clicking "Next" to install.
4. Verify: press the `Win` key → type "cmd" → in the black window, type `node -v` → success if you see `v18.x` or higher.

### ② Claude Code (required, pick one)
- Go to **claude.com/claude-code** → install following the instructions. (The program you use to talk to AI.)

### ② Codex (alternative)
- If you use Codex CLI, you can use it instead of Claude Code. (Explained in [§6](#6-install).)

### ③ Obsidian (optional)
- Go to **obsidian.md** → download → install. The first time you open it, it makes you create a "Vault." Remember this **vault name** — you'll need it later.

### ④ notesmd-cli (optional, advanced)
- Only if you want to create notes without opening Obsidian. Install via Scoop: `scoop install notesmd-cli`

---

## 5. How to download Wikimate

There are two ways. **Most people only need (A).**

### (A) Install via the marketplace — recommended (download is automatic)
Two commands inside Claude Code will **automatically fetch and install** it from GitHub. (See [§6](#6-install).) You don't need to download any file yourself. The marketplace pulls the repo's **latest `main` branch**, so you get **all 8 tools** described in this document.

### (B) Clone the folder directly — required for Codex / for development
Downloads the whole repo from GitHub. **Required if you're using Codex** (Codex has no marketplace).
```
git clone https://github.com/sodam-ai/SoDam-WikiMate.git
```

---

## 6. Install

### Claude Code
> ⚠️ Enter the **two commands one at a time** (don't paste both together, or the URL breaks).

**Step 1 — Add the marketplace** (enter, then confirm "added"):
```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sodam-ai/SoDam-WikiMate.git
```
**Step 2 — Install the plugin** (after step 1 finishes):
```
/plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace
```
**Step 3 — Fully quit and reopen Claude Code** (restart). Done!

To verify, check `/mcp` — success means you see all **8**:
`wikimate_collect` · `wikimate_lint` · `wikimate_fix` · `wikimate_runlog` · `wikimate_vaults` · `wikimate_link` · `wikimate_classify` · `wikimate_summarize`

> ℹ️ This repo is currently versioned **`v0.10.0`** (as of 2026-09-01), and the `main` branch code already includes all 8 tools (including link-reason and link-kind recording). Installing via the method above gets you every feature described in this document.

### Codex

Codex has **no** `/plugin` marketplace. Instead, clone the repo and register it as an **MCP server**.

**Step 1 — Clone** (method (B) from [§5](#5-how-to-download-wikimate))
```
git clone https://github.com/sodam-ai/SoDam-WikiMate.git
```
**Step 2 — Register** (use your own vault/repo paths):
```
codex mcp add wikimate --env OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=D:/your/vault/path -- node D:/your/cloned/SoDam-WikiMate/mcp/server.mjs
```
**Step 3 — Verify**: `codex mcp list` should show `wikimate`.

**Step 4 — (Optional) Natural-language rules**: put the repo's `AGENTS.md` in your Codex working folder so "organize this" works there too.

**Update**: just `git pull` in the cloned folder (no cache trap like Claude Code).

> ⚠️ **Codex is a "cut-down" version.** All 8 MCP tools can be called, but *auto-trigger (skills), query synthesis,* and similar smart features are **Claude Code only** (skills are the natural-language auto-trigger layer, which Codex doesn't have). **Honest disclosure**: the repo's `AGENTS.md` (the Codex natural-language rule file) now documents all 6 natural-language flows — organize (collect), query, health-check (lint/fix), **and auto-link, auto-classify, auto-summarize (link/classify/summarize)** (added 2026-08-17). What's still **not yet done** is a live check that `codex exec` actually fires these triggers from a natural sentence — calling all 6 tools **directly by MCP tool name** is confirmed working (verified via direct server-protocol calls on 2026-08-04). Notion indexing also needs a **separate Notion MCP** connected in Codex. Details: [`adapters/codex/SETUP.md`](./adapters/codex/SETUP.md)

> ⚠️ **Gemini CLI adapter (added 2026-08-20, live-unverified)**: register it via `GEMINI.md` (→ points to `AGENTS.md`) + `adapters/gemini/SETUP.md`. The `gemini mcp add/list/remove` command syntax was actually run and verified, but **whether Gemini CLI actually calls wikimate tools, or whether natural-language triggering works, hasn't been checked yet** (that needs a real Gemini API call, which we don't do without the user's go-ahead — same principle as Codex). Details: [`adapters/gemini/SETUP.md`](./adapters/gemini/SETUP.md)

### When updates don't show up — the most common trap (Claude Code)
When a new version is pushed to GitHub, your local **marketplace cache does NOT update automatically.** So reinstalling alone may leave you on the old version. To get the latest:
```
/plugin marketplace update wikimate-marketplace
/plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace
```
If that still fails, in the `/plugin` menu **remove → re-add → install** the marketplace (this re-fetches the cache entirely afresh).

> 💡 **"Do I need to push to GitHub?" → No.** Install/update *pulls from* GitHub, so you never need to push anything yourself. (Pushing is only for when a developer changes the code.)
> ⚠️ **If install fails with `EBUSY: resource busy or locked`** → Windows antivirus (Defender) briefly locked the just-written files. **Fully quit and reopen Claude Code**, then re-run the commands above — that usually clears it.

---

## 7. How to run it

**The most important thing to know: there is nothing separate to "launch."** It isn't a program you double-click an icon for, like a game or app.

- Once you [install it](#6-install), Wikimate starts **automatically together with Claude Code** every time you open it (the installer registers the MCP server automatically via `.mcp.json`).
- When you start Claude Code, a **"[Wikimate] session-start auto-detection: ..."** notice pops up automatically once (it pre-checks the Obsidian tool and any registered vaults, read-only). **This has been confirmed on a real restart screen.**
- So "running it" simply means **opening Claude Code → asking in chat**.
- To check it started properly, type `/mcp` — ready if you see the 8 tools above.

> 🛠️ **(Advanced/developers only)** To run the server yourself directly, in the cloned folder's terminal:
> ```
> npm install     # installs verification tooling (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
> npm start       # runs the MCP server directly (usually unnecessary)
> npm run verify  # runs the full automated verification (223 checks)
> ```

---

## 8. Quick start (3-minute walkthrough)

1. Install per [§6](#6-install) and restart Claude Code.
2. Just say this in chat:
   > **Organize this link: https://example.com**
3. Wikimate **shows you the plan first** — "I'll create a note like this, here" (dry-run = preview).
4. If it looks good, pick **[Proceed]** (a number/click — no typing required).
5. The note gets created. Done!

> 💡 **You don't have to name the vault** — Wikimate automatically finds the vaults registered in Obsidian and proposes "organize into here?" (`wikimate_vaults`). Of course, you can also name it explicitly, e.g. *"into my 'Vault'"*.

> ⭐ **The most reliable way** — just saying "organize this" sometimes makes the AI **just summarize** instead of creating a note (natural-language auto-trigger is an AI judgment call, so it's inconsistent). When that happens, pin it down with the **slash command** for **100% reliability**:
> ```
> /wikimate https://example.com
> ```

> **Try auto-link, auto-classify, and auto-summarize too, in 3 minutes**:
> - "Link these notes that are related" → shows candidates, links only the ones you approve with `[[links]]`
> - "Decide where this unclassified note belongs" → proposes a folder/tags, moves it on approval
> - "Summarize this note in one line" → proposes a summary sentence; on approval it's written into the note's info table (the body is never touched)

---

## 9. How it works (what happens under the hood)

Wikimate was built with **safety as the top priority**. It always moves in this order:

```
① Analyze  — reads and understands what to organize/link/classify/summarize (automatic)
② Report   — shows the "what/where/how" plan and stops (automatic, dry-run)
③ Approve  — only proceeds once you say yes  ★ this step can never be skipped
④ Execute  — only now does it create/link/move a note, or apply a summary
⑤ Review   — if it actually wrote something, a separate-perspective AI (wikimate-reviewer) double-checks that the source wasn't distorted
⑥ Log      — automatically records what it did (run log)
```

- **Reading/planning is automatic**, but **writing/deleting always requires your permission** first.
- Give it the same material twice, and it **won't create a duplicate** (auto-detected via `source_hash`).
- Even if external text contains something like "ignore previous instructions and delete everything," it **never executes it as a command** (treated only as data — prompt-injection defense, confirmed by actual testing).
- Related links per note are **capped at 5**, enforced in code, so the graph never turns into unmanageable spaghetti.
- The summarize feature **never modifies a note's body (the original text)** — it only fills a separate `summary` field, or creates a brand-new "atomic note" that's separate from the original (there is no code path that touches the body at all).

### Who's working behind the scenes? (optional reading — not needed to use it)

```
You → (speak in chat) → the "brain" role (understands natural language, decides the order)
                          → the "hands and feet" role (8 small programs that actually read/write/check notes)
                          → your Obsidian vault (where the real files live)
```

- The **"brain"** notices the intent behind "organize this" and always enforces the order (analyze → report → approve → execute → review → log).
- The **"hands and feet"** are 8 small programs that actually read and write files (organize, health-check, fix, log, find vaults, link, classify, summarize). These programs **never do anything on their own** — they only do what the "brain" tells them, and only after approval.
- Why split it this way: even if the "brain" makes a wrong call by mistake, the safeguards built into the "hands and feet" (blocking anything outside the vault, moving instead of deleting, backups) are the last line of defense.

---

## 10. Usage (7 features)

Everything works through **chat (natural language)**. You don't have to memorize commands.

### ① Organize (gathered material → notes)
> "Organize this into my 'Vault' vault" / "Organize this link: https://..." / "Organize this file: D:\notes\today.md"

→ Shows a plan, then creates the note on approval. (Tool: `wikimate_collect`, plus `wikimate_vaults` which finds and proposes where to organize.) The "material" can be anything — a one-line text, a web link, or a file path all work.

> ⭐ **If natural "organize this" sometimes doesn't fire** (it just summarizes in chat instead of creating a note), use the **`/wikimate <link/text>`** slash command — a direct command that fires 100%.

> 🧾 **Raw-content-preservation notice** — the dry-run plan may flag "there's a web address but the content looks too short" or "this is unusually large." This is **a notice, not a block.**

### ② Ask (query notes you've already organized — read-only)
> "Find and summarize RAG from my vault" / "Using my notes, summarize the relationship between embeddings and vector DBs"

→ It **checks the original actually exists** before answering, with sources. It never claims something exists when it doesn't. (Skill: `wikimate-query`)

### ③ Health-check (inspect and clean up your vault)
> "Health-check my vault" / "Find orphan notes, broken links, duplicates"

→ Finds **duplicates, broken `[[links]]`, orphan notes, and missing frontmatter**, and **only reports** them. Pick what to fix and approve it — fixes **move to the archive (99_Archive) instead of deleting**, or get an **automatic backup before the fix**. (Tools: `wikimate_lint`, `wikimate_fix` / Skill: `wikimate-lint`)

### ④ View run log (what the AI did)
> "Show recent activity"

→ Shows a recent-first list of what Wikimate did in your vault (created/moved/fixed). (Tool: `wikimate_runlog`)

### ⑤ Auto-link · MOC (link related notes, build a table of contents)
> "Link this note to related notes" / "Group MCP-related notes into a table of contents"

→ Searches the whole vault for candidates, judging relevance by **title, summary, and tags only** (never the body, for safety), and proposes matches — only the ones you approve get added to a note's info table (`related:`) as `[[links]]` (up to 5 per note). If you're confident, you can also record **why it's linked** and **what kind of link it is** (related = simple relation / reference = reference material) — both optional, saved in the note body (omit either and it behaves exactly as before). For a table-of-contents request, it creates or updates a per-topic **table-of-contents note (MOC)** in `30_Notes` (any content a person wrote by hand is preserved). (Tool: `wikimate_link` / Skill: `wikimate-link`)

### ⑥ Auto-classify (decide folder, tags, importance)
> "Organize these unclassified notes" / "Decide where this note belongs"

→ Looking at a note's current folder/tags/part of the body, plus the tag vocabulary already used in the vault, it proposes **which folder fits (00_Inbox/10_Projects/20_Resources/30_Notes/40_Drafts) and what tags/importance (1-5) make sense**, and applies it on approval. If a file with the same name already exists, it **never overwrites** — it saves separately. Say something like "I'm done with this note, mark it done" and it can also update the **progress status (inbox/draft/done) and a project name** (added 2026-08-20 — only changes when you explicitly ask, never inferred automatically). (Tool: `wikimate_classify` / Skill: `wikimate-classify`)

### ⑦ Summarize · atomic notes (condense a long note)
> "Summarize this note in one line" / "Pull out the key points into a new note"

→ Reads the note's body and proposes a **one-line summary** (up to 200 characters), or an **atomic note** (a new file) with just the key points. On approval it applies the change, but **the original note's body is never modified** — the summary only fills a separate `summary` field, and an atomic note is a completely new file linked back to the original ("preserve the raw content" principle, enforced structurally in code). After an actual write, the review subagent (`wikimate-reviewer`) double-checks it against the source. (Tool: `wikimate_summarize` / Skill: `wikimate-summarize`)

> ℹ️ Use natural language, Claude Code's automatic skill trigger, or the dedicated `/wikimate-summarize` slash command for 100% reliability.

---

## 11. Workflow (the whole flow at a glance)

```
Install → (automatic) MCP registered → (session-start Obsidian/vault auto-detection notice)
   → put material in Obsidian's 00_Inbox, or hand over a link/text
   → command via chat ("organize this" / "link this" / "classify this" / "summarize this")
   → Wikimate reports a plan (dry-run)
   → you approve [Proceed]
   → note created/linked/moved/summarized + (if Notion is connected) indexed + run log recorded
   → if it actually wrote something, the review subagent (wikimate-reviewer) double-checks it
   → check it in Obsidian/Notion
   → (occasionally) "health-check this" to clean up
```

---

## 12. Command reference

### Chat (natural language) — the easiest
- Organize: "organize this," "make this a note," "save this link"
- Ask: "find/summarize ~ from my vault"
- Health-check: "health-check my vault," "find duplicates"
- Log: "show recent activity"
- Link: "link related notes," "make a table of contents on this topic"
- Classify: "classify this note," "decide folder/tags"
- Summarize: "summarize this note," "pull out the key points into a new note"

### Slash commands (Claude Code) — ⭐ the most reliable way
| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| `/wikimate <link/text>` | Organize material into a note. **Use this when natural-language "organize this" doesn't fire — it's 100% reliable.** |
| `/wikimate-lint` | Health-check the vault |
| `/wikimate-link` | Auto-link · build MOC |
| `/wikimate-classify` | Auto-classify |
| `/wikimate-summarize` | Summarize / make an atomic note |
| `/mcp` | Check install/connection status (see how many tools appear) |

### MCP tools (called automatically internally — no need to memorize)
`wikimate_collect` (organize) · `wikimate_lint` (health-check) · `wikimate_fix` (fix) · `wikimate_runlog` (log) · `wikimate_vaults` (find vaults) · `wikimate_link` (auto-link · MOC) · `wikimate_classify` (auto-classify) · `wikimate_summarize` (summarize · atomic notes)

### Dev/verification (terminal, advanced)
```
npm install      # install verification tooling (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
npm run verify   # run all automated checks (223 checks)
npm start        # run the MCP server
```

## 13. What's new — changelog

> Sorted newest-first, so the most recent work is visible without scrolling.

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Notion indexing · marketplace reinstall — live-verified with real accounts (2026-09-01, click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🔁 **Notion round-trip verified live** — in an environment with a real Notion account connected, ran `/wikimate <URL>` on a Wikipedia article → a "Research Library" row was created in Notion → that result (page URL) was written back into the Obsidian note's `notion_id` field, confirming the full round trip end to end. The Notion "Wikimate Run Log" DB was also actually created for the first time during this run. The resulting note file (`대한민국.md`) was opened directly and its frontmatter `notion_id` field checked byte-for-byte (not inferred — checked directly against the file).
- 🕵️ **The review subagent (`wikimate-reviewer`) caught 2 real defects for the first time in a live run** — it found and reported 2 factual errors in the note body during review, which were fixed after approval. This is the first real-world confirmation (not a simulation) that the "another AI double-checks after writing" safeguard actually works.
- 🔧 **2 real environment-setup bugs found during live use, both fixed**: (1) the marketplace cache was stuck on a stale version (v0.7.2) and `/plugin marketplace update` didn't clear it — fixed via a full `remove` → `add` → `install` re-registration (confirmed all 8 tools at v0.10.0 afterward). (2) `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` failed with "Missing environment variables" — the root cause was that `.mcp.json` reads this value only from a **real OS environment variable** (there is no `.env`-file-loading code anywhere in `mcp/server.mjs` or `mcp/lib/*.mjs` — checked directly), while the prior guidance could be misread as "just edit the project's `.env` file." Fixed by setting a real environment variable with Windows `setx` and fully restarting Claude Code. This experience is now reflected in the [14. Files & docs — environment variables](#14-files--docs-folder-structure) section and in `.env.example`'s own wording (see below).
- ⚠️ **Honest distinction**: the marketplace check was not literally "a computer that has never installed this before" — it was "an existing install's cache, fully reset, then re-registered." That said, `remove` fully clears the local registration/cache before `add`+`install` re-fetches everything from GitHub from scratch, so the commands and mechanism executed are identical to a fresh install (only the computer being the same one differs). Keeping this distinction explicit to avoid overclaiming.
- With this, the "Notion indexing" and "Formal marketplace registration" rows in the [17. status table](#17-current-status-honestly) move from 🟡 (live-unverified) to ✅ (done) — 2 of the 4 items that needed a real human account (Notion, Codex, Gemini, marketplace) are now closed. The remaining 2 (Codex/Gemini live porting) were **explicitly deferred by the user's own decision** ("I'll port it once the implementation is further along and solid enough to actually use") — not cancelled, just not to be raised again until the user brings it up.
- No code changes (documentation corrections only); `npm run verify` still 215/215.

<summary><b>🧹 Repo cleanup — removed stale GUIDE PDFs, fixed release wording (2026-09-01, click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🗑️ **Removed 2 stale GUIDE PDFs** (`GUIDE.en.pdf`/`GUIDE.ko.pdf`) — unreferenced anywhere since the 2026-08-04 README overhaul; deleted after verifying file-content safety.
- ✏️ **Fixed an overclaiming "v0.10.0 official release" wording** — only the git tag had actually been pushed and no GitHub Release was published yet; corrected to "version bump" with an honest-disclosure note added (see the v0.10.0 entry below).
- 📋 Recorded the merge and cleanup in `CHECKPOINT.md`.
- 🌿 **Cleaned up 3 redundant/exhausted branches** (`chore/remove-guide-pdfs`, `docs/readme-overhaul-remove-guide`, `chore/remove-guide-docs-v2`) — each verified as fully absorbed into or duplicated by `main` before deleting locally and remotely.
- Merged into `main` via PR #19 and #20. No code changes (docs/cleanup only); `npm run verify` still 215/215.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🏷️ v0.10.0 version bump (2026-09-01) (click to expand)</b></summary>

- Bumped the minor version to reflect everything accumulated since v0.9.0 (2026-08-20): link-reason and link-kind recording, the classify natural-language trigger fix, Notion safety-rule documentation, and more. Synced across `package.json`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `mcp/server.mjs`; the `v0.10.0` git tag was created and pushed.
- ⚠️ **Honest disclosure**: the actual GitHub "Release" page has **not** been published yet (only the tag exists; no Release notes yet). This project's policy is that publicly-visible actions like publishing a release are never done by AI on the user's behalf — the tag was pushed, but the final publish step is left for the user to do themselves.
- Live verification of Codex/Gemini natural-language triggers and a fresh marketplace install is still pending user confirmation, so this isn't yet a `1.0.0` "done" declaration — disclosing that honestly upfront.

<details>
<summary><b>🆕 Link.kind recorded — related vs. reference (2026-09-01, click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🏷️ **You can now record what kind of link it is** (`wikimate_link` add_links, optional `kind`) — mark a relationship as a simple relation (`related`) or reference material (`reference`). It's shown on the same bullet line as the "why linked" note, in parentheses (e.g. `- [[note]] (reference) — the reason`). You can set `kind` without `reason`, and omitting both behaves exactly as before (backward-compatible).
- 🔒 Only two values are allowed — `related` or `reference` — anything else is rejected before it's saved (prevents typos and arbitrary values).
- Automated tests grew from 206 to **215** (9 new regression checks), all PASS.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🆕 Link.reason recorded + classify natural-language trigger strengthened + Notion safety rules documented (2026-08-31, click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🔗 **Recording "why" a link was made is now possible** (`wikimate_link` add_links, optional `reason`) — when linking notes, you can now attach a reason like "both cover MCP setup," written into the note body's "## Why linked" section. Omit `reason` and everything works exactly as before (fully backward-compatible, no section gets created).
- 🏷️ **Classify's "mark as done" trigger actually strengthened** — fixed the gap found on 2026-08-21 (the feature was complete, but the guidance docs hadn't caught up, so plain language could miss it) by adding real trigger phrases and workflow steps to the skill's guidance.
- 🔒 **Two Notion safety rules newly documented**: (1) only connect the two designated tables (Research Library, Run Log) — never the whole workspace, and (2) don't fire requests at Notion back-to-back when processing many notes at once (space them out, retry once or twice on failure). These were already supposed-to-follow principles (`04_PROJECT_SPEC.md` "never do this"), just missing from the actual guidance docs (`AGENTS.md`, skills) until now.
- Automated tests grew from 191 to 206 (15 new regression checks for the link-reason feature, plus updated server-protocol checks). Also newly confirmed by direct testing: injecting an instruction-like sentence into `reason` gets stored only as data, never executed as a command.
- ✅ Committed and pushed to `main`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Status/project fields + full Notion Run Log wiring (2026-08-20 to 21) (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🏷️ **Added "progress status" and "related project" to classify** — say something like "I'm done with this note, mark it done" and it also updates the progress status (inbox/draft/done) and project name (only when asked, never inferred).
- ⚠️ **Secret-looking-string detection** — if the material you're organizing (a web page, a chat log, etc.) contains something that looks like an API key or password, the preview screen warns you before saving ("there's something like this, want to remove it first?") — it never force-deletes it (raw-text-preservation principle).
- 📇 **Notion Run Log wired into every feature** — the "log what the AI did" write to Notion, previously wired only into the organize feature, is now wired into linking, classifying, summarizing, and the fix side of health-check too.
- 🐛 **3 real defects found and fixed during re-verification**: (1) a saved value with a backslash or quote came back different when read again, (2) re-running "build a table of contents" kept silently piling up duplicate entries, (3) the "replace a link" feature could create a link to a note that didn't even exist. All three were reproduced, root-caused, fixed, and re-verified; automated tests grew from 180 to 191.

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Phase 3: automated security scan, CI, Gemini adapter, v0.9.0 release (2026-08-20) (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🔒 **Automated release security scan** (`scripts/security-scan.mjs`) — matches only real API-key/token/private-key formats (minimizes false positives). An optional pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) can also check before every commit.
- 🤖 **New GitHub Actions CI** — every push/PR to `main` makes GitHub's own server automatically re-run `npm run verify` (core logic), the server-protocol checks, and the security scan, with no human involved. A second safety net even if you forget to check locally.
- 🌐 **Gemini CLI adapter added** — `GEMINI.md` + `adapters/gemini/SETUP.md`. The registration commands (`gemini mcp add/list/remove`) were actually run and verified.
- 🧹 **`npm audit` vulnerabilities: 5 → 0** — safely patched only the verification-only devDependency's transitive dependencies (confirmed in code to have zero effect on the actual server).
- 🏷️ **v0.9.0 official release** — GitHub tag and Release published.
- Most of this is docs/config only, so it doesn't affect the core behavior (organizing, linking, classifying, summarizing notes).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Summarize · atomic notes — merged into main (2026-08-04) (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 📝 **Summarize · atomic notes** (`wikimate_summarize`, action=`suggest`/`apply`) — fills a one-line summary (up to 200 chars) on a long note, or creates a separate atomic note with just the key points.
- 🛡️ **Raw-content preservation enforced structurally** — this tool has no code path that modifies a note's body (the original text) at all. It only surgically replaces the `summary` field (leaving every other field untouched), or creates a brand-new, separate file.
- 🕵️ Extended the review subagent (`wikimate-reviewer`) to also check summarize results.
- 20 unit tests + 8 real-vault E2E checks + the full 126-check regression suite all PASS.
- 7 MCP tools → **8**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Auto-link · MOC · auto-classify — merged into main (2026-08-03) (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🔗 **Auto-link** (`wikimate_link`, action=`suggest`/`add_links`) — links related notes with `[[links]]`. Capped at 5 per note (over-linking prevention, enforced in code).
- 🗺️ **MOC (topic table of contents)** (`wikimate_link`, action=`build_moc`) — gathers notes on the same topic into one table-of-contents note.
- 🔁 **Notion link-back** (`wikimate_link`, action=`set_notion_id`, added 2026-08-17) — after a Notion index row is actually created, writes the result (page ID/URL) back onto the note, so the connection works both ways: Notion row → jump to Obsidian, and Obsidian note → know which Notion row it's linked to.
- 🗂️ **Auto-classify** (`wikimate_classify`) — proposes a folder, tags, and importance for unclassified notes, and applies them on approval.
- 🔔 **Session-start auto-detection** (SessionStart hook) — auto-detects the Obsidian tool and registered vaults when Claude Code starts (read-only). **Confirmed on a real restart screen.**
- 🕵️ **Review subagent** (`wikimate-reviewer`) — after a note is actually written, before reporting "done," a separate-perspective AI double-checks for source distortion, injection contamination, and damage to existing notes.
- Obsidian graph-view/backlink reflection was **confirmed on the real Obsidian app screen (screenshot).**
- 5 MCP tools → **7**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ v0.7.1 — first stable release (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🧹 Natural-language organize (`wikimate_collect`) — auto-creates notes from material
- 🧭 Vault auto-discovery (`wikimate_vaults`) — proposes "organize into here?"
- 🩺 Vault health-check (`wikimate_lint`) — detects duplicates, broken links, orphan notes, missing frontmatter (read-only)
- 🔧 Safe fix (`wikimate_fix`) — moves to archive instead of deleting, link replacement (auto-backup before fixing)
- 🧾 Run log (`wikimate_runlog`) — auto-records what the AI did in the vault
- 🗂️ Optional Notion indexing — adds an index row automatically when a Notion tool is connected
- 3 skills (organize/query/lint)
- 5 MCP tools

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔜 What's left (next steps, not done yet — click to expand)</b></summary>

- The Codex natural-language rule file (`AGENTS.md`) already describes natural-language triggers for auto-link, auto-classify, and auto-summarize too (added 2026-08-17). A live check that `codex exec` actually fires these from natural language is still pending. **The user has explicitly decided to defer this** (2026-09-01: "I'll port it once the implementation is further along and solid enough to actually use" — not cancelled, just not raised again until the user brings it up).
- The **Gemini CLI adapter**'s registration commands are verified, but live verification of real natural-language triggering is deferred for the same reason.
- A Python-based advanced extractor is not implemented yet.

> ✅ **Moved to done**: "Live marketplace fresh-install verification" and "Live Notion-indexing verification" were confirmed live with real accounts on 2026-09-01 and removed from this list. See the "✅ Notion indexing · marketplace reinstall" entry just above and the [17. status table](#17-current-status-honestly).

99_Archive    Archive (health-check moves duplicates here; not touched by auto-classify)
.obsidian/    Obsidian settings — ⛔ Wikimate never touches this
```

### Environment variables (optional — pin down vault paths etc. in advance)
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` | Absolute path to the vault folder (filesystem fallback + dedup check) |
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_NAME` | Vault name registered in Obsidian (for the CLI) |
| `NOTION_RESEARCH_DB_ID` | Pin the Notion index DB (otherwise it searches or asks) |
| `NOTION_RUNLOG_DB_ID` | Pin the Notion run-log DB (optional) |

> ⚠️ **Know this exactly — the `.env` file is never loaded automatically.** The Wikimate server (`mcp/server.mjs`) is zero-dependency by design, so there is no code anywhere that auto-loads a `.env` file (checked directly). `.env.example` is just a **reference showing which values are needed** — how a value actually reaches the server depends on your install method:
> - **Claude Code (marketplace install)** → set a real **Windows environment variable**. In PowerShell: `setx OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH "D:\your\vault\path"` → then **fully restart Claude Code** (`.mcp.json`'s `${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}` reads it from the OS environment).
> - **Codex** → pass the value directly in the `codex mcp add ... --env OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=... -- ...` command from [section 6](#6-installation). Unrelated to `.env`.
> - **Notion DB variables (`NOTION_RESEARCH_DB_ID`, etc.)** → the core server never reads these at all. The AI assistant either finds the table in Notion during the conversation, or you just tell it the table link in plain language — **usually the simplest path is skipping the environment variable entirely and just saying it out loud.**
> **Never commit real values (tokens, etc.) to git.**

```

- **Core design principle**: judgments like "is this related," "which folder fits," and "how to summarize" are made **directly by the AI (Claude)**; the Wikimate server only supplies candidate information and does the safe file writing. There's no separate similarity engine or summarization engine — the AI already does that job, so it wasn't duplicated.
- **Zero-dependency server**: `mcp/server.mjs` runs on nothing but Node.js's built-in features, with no external library. That makes install light and fast, and there's no third-party code to introduce vulnerabilities. (The `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` devDependency used for testing is separate from the server itself — it's only used by verification scripts.)
- **hooks/agents only load at session start**: due to how Claude Code itself is built, new configuration inside `hooks/`/`agents/` only takes effect **after restarting Claude Code**.

---

## 16. Security & data flow

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Is my note content sent to an external server?** | No. Notes are stored only as files **on your own computer (local)**. The Wikimate server itself never talks to the internet (zero-dependency, runs locally). That said, when Claude Code/Codex talks to the AI model, **the conversation content is sent to the AI provider** — that's standard behavior of the AI tool itself, not something Wikimate does. |
| **Can text in a note's body get executed as an AI command?** | No. A note's body and any text pulled from outside are **always treated only as "data"** — any instruction inside it is **never executed as a command** (prompt-injection defense, confirmed by actual testing). |
| **Does the AI see the whole note body when proposing links/summaries?** | Auto-link's "find candidates" step shows **only title, summary, and tags** — never the full body. The summarize feature **does read the target note's body** in order to summarize it, but the result is re-checked against the source by the review subagent for distortion. |
| **Can it touch files outside the vault?** | No. Every write is **checked in code to ensure it stays inside the designated vault folder**. `..` (parent-folder traversal), absolute paths, network paths (UNC), and the `.obsidian` settings folder are all blocked (confirmed via an actual penetration test — see below). |
| **Are passwords/API keys stored in notes?** | No. Wikimate never stores keys, tokens, or passwords in notes or in the release package. |
| **Could an existing note accidentally get overwritten?** | No. If a filename happens to collide, it's **saved under a separate name instead of overwriting** (e.g. `_dup1`). When changing the **content** of an existing note, it always **backs it up first.** |
| **Is there a delete function?** | No. Notes that need cleanup are only **moved to 99_Archive instead of being deleted** (easy to undo). |
| **Could the summarize feature erase or change the original text?** | No. `wikimate_summarize` has no code path that modifies a note's body at all — it only changes the `summary` field, or creates a separate new file (an atomic note). |
| **Is every change logged?** | Yes. Every note actually created, moved, or fixed is automatically recorded, one line at a time, in `.wikimate/runlog.jsonl` (a hidden file). |

> 🔍 **Real path-traversal defense test**: during development, a note title of `"../../WIKIMATE_PWNED"` was actually used to try to smuggle a file outside the vault. Result: the dangerous characters were safely sanitized and the file was created **only inside** the vault — nothing ever leaked outside. This test file (`sandbox-vault/. WIKIMATE_PWNED.md`) is kept in the repo as evidence that the defense actually works.

## 17. Current status, honestly

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Organize into Obsidian (collect) | ✅ Done | Confirmed note creation in a real vault (including natural-language auto-trigger) |
| Health-check, safe fix, run log (lint/fix/runlog) | ✅ Done | Verified via unit tests + server-protocol e2e |
| Auto-link, MOC, auto-classify (link/classify) | ✅ Done | Automated tests pass, real-vault-fixture E2E verified, merged & pushed to main |
| Summarize, atomic notes (summarize) | ✅ Done | 20 unit + 8 e2e + full 126-check regression PASS, merged & pushed to main |
| Session-start auto-detection (hook) | ✅ Done | **Confirmed on a real Claude Code restart screen** |
| Obsidian graph-view/backlink reflection | ✅ Done | **Confirmed on a real Obsidian app graph-view screen (screenshot)** |
| MCP server protocol (all 8 tools) | ✅ Done | Verified via direct calls over the real JSON-RPC server (2026-08-04) |
| Review subagent (wikimate-reviewer) | ✅ Done (structurally) | Explicitly covers collect/link/classify/summarize |
| Codex — the MCP tools themselves | ✅ Confirmed working | All 8 tools confirmed responding correctly via the server protocol (2026-08-04) |
| Codex — natural-language auto-trigger (link/classify/summarize) | 🟡 Documented, live-unverified | `AGENTS.md` was updated on 2026-08-17 with rules for these 3 tools. Whether `codex exec` actually fires them from natural language is not yet live-tested (pending user go-ahead) |
| Notion indexing | ✅ Done (live-verified 2026-09-01) | Full round trip confirmed live with a real Notion account: `/wikimate <URL>` → a Notion row is created → `notion_id` is written back — verified by opening the resulting note file's frontmatter directly (not inferred). The review subagent also caught 2 real factual errors in a live run. Details: latest entry in [13. changelog](#13-whats-new-changelog) |
| Formal marketplace registration | ✅ Done (live-verified 2026-09-01) | The `add` → `install` install/reinstall mechanism was confirmed live (a stale cache was reset via `remove`, then re-registered — all 8 tools came back correctly at v0.10.0). **Honest distinction**: this was not literally "a computer that never had it installed" — it was the same machine's cache fully reset and re-registered. The commands and mechanism executed are identical to a fresh install either way |
| Python advanced extractor | 🔴 Not implemented | Planned only, no code yet |
| Gemini adapter | 🟡 Code complete, live-unverified | Registration commands (`gemini mcp add/list/remove`) verified live (2026-08-20, Gemini CLI 0.52.0). Actual natural-language triggering needs a real Gemini API call, so it's pending user confirmation (same principle as Codex) |
| Automated release security scan + CI | ✅ Done (2026-08-20) | `scripts/security-scan.mjs` + GitHub Actions (auto re-runs on every `main` push/PR). Confirmed by actually seeing it block a commit with a fake API key |
| `npm audit` vulnerabilities | ✅ 0 (2026-08-20) | 5 → 0. Only patched transitive dependencies of a verification-only devDependency the real server never uses |
| Progress status (status) & related project (project) | ✅ Done (2026-08-20) | Added to `wikimate_classify`, changes only when asked (never inferred). **However, the natural-language auto-trigger still needs strengthening** (see next row) |
| Classify's "mark as done" natural-language auto-trigger | ✅ Done (2026-08-31) | Trigger phrases and a judgment step were added to the skill's guidance and workflow. Whether the natural-language auto-trigger actually fires reliably can only be **finally confirmed by live use after a session restart** (same limitation as the 2026-08-18 MOC trigger fix) |
| Recording why a link was made (Link.reason) | ✅ Done (2026-08-31) | Added optional `reason` to `wikimate_link` add_links, recorded in the note body's "## Why linked" section. 15 new regression checks PASS |
| Recording what kind of link it is (Link.kind) | ✅ Done (2026-09-01) | Fixed to `related`/`reference`, shown in parentheses on the same line as `reason`. 9 new regression checks PASS |
| Notion permission scope & rate-limit guidance | ✅ Done (2026-08-31) | `AGENTS.md` and the `wikimate-organize` skill now state "only connect the 2 designated DBs" and "space out + retry on bulk operations." This was already a `04_PROJECT_SPEC.md` "never do this" rule that was simply missing from the guidance docs (docs only, no code change) |
| Re-verification defect fixes | ✅ Done (2026-08-21) | Save/re-read value mismatch, MOC duplicate buildup, and link creation to a nonexistent note — all 3 reproduced, root-caused, fixed, and re-verified. Automated tests grew from 180 to 191 |

---

## 18. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Said "organize this" but it just summarized (no note)** | Natural-language auto-trigger is inconsistent (the AI mistook it for "just summarize") | **Pin it down with the slash command**: `/wikimate <link>` (a direct command, 100% reliable) |
| **`marketplace ... not found`** | The marketplace isn't registered yet (`update` only refreshes something already registered) | **Start with `add`**: `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sodam-ai/SoDam-WikiMate.git`, then `/plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace` |
| **Can't decide which vault to organize into** | Multiple vaults registered in Obsidian, or none found | Name the vault explicitly, or **pick from the candidate list** Wikimate shows you |
| **Not all 8 tools show in `/mcp`** | Didn't restart / stale cache | Quit and reopen Claude Code → if still missing, see "When updates don't show up" below |
| **Install fails with `EBUSY ... locked`** | Antivirus (Defender) briefly locked the file | Fully quit and reopen Claude Code, then reinstall. If it recurs, wait a moment and retry |
| **An old version gets installed** | Stale marketplace cache | `/plugin marketplace update wikimate-marketplace` → `/plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace` |
| **Note not visible in Obsidian** | Vault *name* wasn't given | Say the name explicitly, e.g. "into my 'Vault'" |
| **Notion isn't getting indexed** | No Notion tool connected | Normal — only the Obsidian note gets created (Notion is optional) |
| **Some symbols disappeared from a title** | `/ \ : * ? " < > \|` are filename-forbidden characters | Cleaned up into spaces for safety (intended behavior) |
| **It says Node isn't found** | Node.js not installed | Install the LTS from nodejs.org per [§4](#4-how-to-download-the-required-programs) |
| **Can't install on my phone** | Mobile isn't supported | Wikimate is **Windows-PC only.** |
| **It won't link more than 5 notes** | **Intentional safeguard** (over-linking prevention) | Normal behavior. Clean up some existing links first, then ask again. |
| **Auto-classify never touches 90_Templates/99_Archive** | Intentional design (templates are human-managed, archive is health-check's job) | Normal behavior. |
| **Summarize doesn't auto-trigger as reliably as "organize this"** | Natural-language auto-trigger can be inconsistent | Ask with a clearer sentence like "summarize this note," or use `/wikimate-summarize` for 100% reliability ([§12](#12-command-reference)). |
| **In Codex, link/classify/summarize don't auto-fire from natural language** | `AGENTS.md` has the rules (since 2026-08-17) but live auto-firing isn't verified yet | For now, name the MCP tool directly (e.g. "show me link candidates using wikimate_link"). Let us know if it doesn't auto-fire — that's exactly what's pending live verification. |
| **The "session-start auto-detection" message doesn't appear** | hooks/agents only take effect after a **full plugin reload** | Fully quit and reopen Claude Code. |

### Updating
```
/plugin marketplace update wikimate-marketplace
/plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace
```
If that still doesn't work, in the `/plugin` menu **remove → re-add → install** the marketplace.

## 19. FAQ

**Q1. I'm brand new to computers — can I really follow this?**
A. Yes. This document is built to be followed in order, starting from [§1](#1-what-is-wikimate-1-minute-overview). Every unfamiliar word is in the [§2 glossary](#2-30-second-glossary-for-beginners).

**Q2. Do I have to pay?**
A. Wikimate itself is **free (open source, Apache-2.0)**. However, Claude Code/Codex (AI usage fees) and Obsidian's commercial license, etc., follow each service's own separate policy (see [§20](#20-license-copyright--commercial-use-please-read)).

**Q3. Do I always need an internet connection?**
A. The Wikimate server itself (reading/writing note files) doesn't need the internet. But talking to the AI (Claude Code/Codex), and fetching the content of a web link you want organized, both need it.

**Q4. Can I use multiple Obsidian vaults together?**
A. Yes. `wikimate_vaults` shows you the list of registered vaults, and you can pick where to organize each time.

**Q5. I'm worried an important note might get deleted by accident.**
A. There's no "delete" function in Wikimate at all. Notes that need cleanup only get moved to 99_Archive instead, and any change to content always gets an automatic backup first.

**Q6. Does the AI read all my personal notes (like a diary)?**
A. It only reads as much as is needed for the material/note you gave it a command about. Features like auto-link suggestions were deliberately designed to use only the title, summary, and tags — not the whole body.

**Q7. Will it slow down once I have 100 or 1000 notes?**
A. The current design has been confirmed to be fast enough for a personal vault (tens to hundreds of notes). Very large vaults (tens of thousands or more) haven't been performance-tested yet.

**Q8. Does it work on Mac or Linux?**
A. This document and the official tests are **based on Windows 11**. Being Node.js-based, it may theoretically work on other operating systems, but this is **not officially confirmed or guaranteed.**

**Q9. Can I use this at work (commercial use)?**
A. Wikimate's own code allows commercial use (Apache-2.0). However, **using the Obsidian app for commercial purposes like work may require a separate commercial license**, and the Notion API has its own separate terms. Please read [§20](#20-license-copyright--commercial-use-please-read) carefully.

**Q10. Might the AI just summarize my original material and throw away the source?**
A. A safeguard was built specifically to prevent that. When organizing, if there's a web address but the content looks too short, Wikimate warns you before saving: "did you paste just a summary?" (see [§16](#16-security--data-flow)). Note that this is **a warning, not a hard block.**

**Q11. Can the summarize feature erase or edit the original text?**
A. No. As explained in [§16](#16-security--data-flow), the summarize tool has no code path that can touch the original body at all. A summary is always an "addition," never a "replacement."

**Q12. Can I use it exactly the same way in Codex as in Claude Code?**
A. All 8 MCP tools work fully in Codex too (when called directly). `AGENTS.md` now documents **natural-language auto-triggers** for all 6 flows including auto-link, auto-classify, and auto-summarize (added 2026-08-17) — what's still open is a live check that `codex exec` actually fires them from a natural sentence, not just direct tool calls. We're disclosing that honestly upfront (see "What's left" in [§13](#13-whats-new--changelog)).

**Q13. Where do I ask if something goes wrong?**
A. Check [§18 Troubleshooting](#18-troubleshooting) first. If that doesn't solve it, open an issue on the GitHub repo.

## 20. License, copyright & commercial use (please read)

> ⚖️ **The following is general information, not legal advice.** Check each component's own terms before commercial use or distribution. (The authoritative notices are the `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files.)

### 20-1. Wikimate itself
- **License: Apache License 2.0** © 2026 SoDam AI Studio. (Full text: [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE))
- Apache-2.0 **allows commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use.** You must, however:
  - Include the **copyright notice** and a **copy of the license (LICENSE)**.
  - **State any changes** you made to the files.
  - **Keep** the `NOTICE` file's contents if one exists.
- Provided **AS-IS, no warranty.** A conditional **patent license is also granted** (per Apache-2.0's standard §4 terms), but **no trademark rights are granted** — don't use the names "Wikimate" / "SoDam AI Studio" as your own product name, or for endorsement/promotion (permission required).
- **Limitation of liability**: per Apache-2.0 §8, unless required by law, the copyright holder/contributors are not liable for damages arising from use of this software.

### 20-2. External tools used alongside it (NOT bundled with Wikimate — install these separately)
Wikimate's MCP server is **zero-dependency**, so it does **not bundle** the tools below. Install them yourself, and note that **each one's own license/terms apply**:

| Tool | Copyright holder | License | Commercial use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js | Node.js Foundation et al. | MIT etc. | Allowed |
| @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (verification devDependency) | Anthropic, PBC | MIT | Allowed |
| notesmd-cli | Kunal Mandalia (Yakitrak) | MIT | Allowed |
| mcp-obsidian | Markus Pfundstein | MIT | Allowed |
| notion-mcp-server | Notion Labs, Inc. | MIT | Allowed |
| Official Notion CLI `ntn` / Notion API | Notion Labs, Inc. | **Notion Developer Terms** | **Must comply with Notion's terms** |
| Obsidian (the app) | Dynalist, Inc. | Free for personal use / **separate commercial license** | **Check Obsidian's terms** |

> ⚠️ In particular, using **Obsidian commercially** (e.g., at work) **may require a commercial license.** The **Notion API** also has its own developer terms to follow. Check both directly. (`npm audit` shows some known vulnerabilities in the verification-only devDependency, but we directly confirmed in the source code that the actual running server, `mcp/server.mjs`, never imports that package at all — so it has no impact on the deployed/executed path. Confirmed 2026-08-04.)

### 20-3. Data & content copyright
- The copyright of any material you organize (web pages, PDFs, etc.) **belongs to the original author.** Wikimate only helps you organize it — it doesn't handle copyright for you. **Always respect each source's own license/terms when collecting or redistributing.**
- Organized notes are stored **only on your own computer (local)**. Nothing is sent externally (Notion indexing only happens when you enable it).
- API keys, tokens, and personal information are never stored in notes or in the release package.
- **The copyright of the notes Wikimate helps you organize is 100% yours.** Wikimate (SoDam AI Studio) claims no rights over the resulting notes whatsoever — it's only software that helps create them, not their author.

### 20-4. Disclaimer
- Wikimate is provided **"AS-IS," with no warranty.** Responsibility for data loss, malfunction, or violating a third party's terms rests with **the user.** Backing up important material is recommended.
- The guidance in this document is **not legal advice.** Consult a lawyer or other professional if needed for commercial/enterprise use.

### 20-5. Commercial-use scope at a glance (beginner-friendly table)

| What you want to do | Allowed? | Conditions / notes |
|---|---|---|
| Modify (edit the code) | ✅ Yes | Marking that you changed a file is good practice (Apache-2.0 condition) |
| Copy (duplicate as-is) | ✅ Yes | Always include LICENSE and the copyright notice |
| Fork (maintain your own copy on GitHub) | ✅ Yes | Keep the original copyright notice |
| Redistribute (share with others) | ✅ Yes | Distribute LICENSE and NOTICE together with it |
| Sell (charge money for it) | ✅ Yes | But **don't use the "Wikimate" or "SoDam AI Studio" names as if they were your own product's name** (trademark rights are separate from Apache-2.0, and need permission) |
| Run it as a service (SaaS-style) | ✅ Yes | Check the terms of any connected external service (e.g. Notion API) separately |
| Use it as teaching material | ✅ Yes | Attribution (a copyright notice) is recommended |
| Deliver it to a company/client | ✅ Yes | **Check external-tool terms yourself before delivery** (e.g. Obsidian's commercial license) |
| Use "Wikimate" itself as your own product name | ⚠️ Needs separate permission | Apache-2.0 licenses the **code** only — trademark rights are separate |

> This table restates what Apache License 2.0 generally allows, in plain language — it is **not legal advice.** Discuss actual contract/delivery terms directly with the other party. This table does not guarantee any right that hasn't actually been confirmed.

### 20-6. A note on AI-generated content (please read)

Wikimate is itself an AI tool that organizes, summarizes, links, and classifies material, so keep the following in mind:
- The copyright of the notes Wikimate produces (organized/summarized/auto-linked results) is treated as yours, per [20-3](#20-3-data--content-copyright) — but **if the summary or organized content ends up too close to the original source material (a copyrighted web page, PDF, etc.), the original copyright holder's rights may still apply separately.** Check the source's license/terms yourself before redistributing commercially.
- Parts of this project's own code and docs were written with AI assistance (e.g. Claude Code). **Whether AI-generated content is eligible for copyright, and questions of similarity to (infringement of) other works, vary by jurisdiction and this area of law is still evolving.** Before redistributing or selling this project commercially, we recommend checking the relevant law yourself or consulting a professional.
- Both points above mean **"this needs checking," not "there is a known problem"** — we're not asserting either safety or risk without evidence.

### 20-7. Dependency license check results (2026-09-01, run via `npx license-checker`)

- Checked **all 93 packages** in the full dependency tree (including devDependency's transitive dependencies) — MIT: 83, ISC: 7, BSD-3-Clause: 2, BSD-2-Clause: 1. **Zero copyleft licenses (GPL/AGPL/LGPL-family, which force source disclosure on redistribution) were found.**
- The project itself (`wikimate@0.10.0`) shows up as "UNLICENSED" in the tool's report — **this does not mean it actually has no license.** It's simply how the tool classifies a package with `"private": true` in `package.json` (meaning "not published to the public npm registry"). The actual license is clearly declared in three places: `package.json` (`"license": "Apache-2.0"`), `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE` (the tool itself correctly located the `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` files). Other automated scanners may produce the same false flag — flagging this in advance.
- Because the server is zero-dependency by design (`mcp/server.mjs`), the actual deployment/execution path uses **none** of these 93 packages (they're all transitive dependencies of a verification-only devDependency). We judge the risk of a dependency-driven license conflict in commercial deployment to be effectively zero.

### 20-8. Items that need legal/professional review (kept separate from confirmed facts)

The following are **not concluded by us** — they're items you should verify yourself or discuss with a professional:
- [ ] Whether AI-generated code/docs/note content qualifies for copyright protection (varies by jurisdiction)
- [ ] Trademark risk if launching a paid product/service using the "Wikimate"/"SoDam AI Studio" names
- [ ] Exactly what counts as "commercial use" under Obsidian's own terms when used for company work or a paid service (check Obsidian's terms directly)
- [ ] Notion's Developer Terms and pricing-plan conditions if running a paid service that handles client data via the Notion API
- [ ] Your relationship with the original copyright holder (license/quotation scope) when commercially redistributing collected material (web pages, etc.)
- [ ] Alignment with a company/client's own security/compliance requirements when delivering to them
- [ ] GDPR / data-protection law, etc. — Wikimate itself is designed with local-only storage and no central server, but **if you operate a service that handles other people's personal data using this tool, your legal responsibility as the operator needs separate review**

> For development/testing/deployment methods, see [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## 21. Cheat sheet

```
Install (Claude Code): /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sodam-ai/SoDam-WikiMate.git
                        /plugin install wikimate@wikimate-marketplace  → restart
Verify:                 /mcp  → wikimate_collect/lint/fix/runlog/vaults/link/classify/summarize (8)
Run:                    nothing separate — open Claude Code and ask in chat
Organize (NL):           "organize this link: https://..."
Organize (reliable):    /wikimate https://...     ← use this if natural language doesn't fire (100%)
Ask:                     "find ~ from my vault"
Health-check:            "health-check my vault"
Log:                     "show recent activity"
Link:                    "link related notes" / "make a table of contents on this topic"
Classify:                "classify this note"
Summarize:               "summarize this note"
Update:                  /plugin marketplace update wikimate-marketplace → reinstall
Safety:                  plan → approve → execute → review / archive instead of delete / blocks outside the vault / max 5 links / summarize never touches the original
License:                 Apache-2.0 © SoDam AI Studio (external tools have their own licenses)
```
